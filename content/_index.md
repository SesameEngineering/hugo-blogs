Sesame by ITRenew makes products for hyperscalers, developers,
and others with a low TCO by leveraging the supply chaining through
hardware sustainability fostered by the circular datacenter.

The circular datacenter allows us to use reuse high end
hardware and extending the life of hardware for as long as it be
supported. However long term sustainability cannot happen without
open firmware and critical open source software like the Linux
kernel.

The blogs here are written by the Sesame Engineering team about their
contributions to the ecosystems that we depend on and show casing
important open source projects through the use of our flagship product
Fast-Start - 4 node workstation based on open hardware as designed and
supported by the Open Compute Project.
